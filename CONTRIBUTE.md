# Basic Structure
The python file `main.py` is where the execution starts from. It contains classes for every page. These classes import the .ui file generated by Qt Designer. Qt Designer is a drag and drop UI Designer developed by the Qt Community. It does not have a steep learning curve and you can learn it easily. These classes contain all the elements in that specific page. These pages are connected to each other through a QStackedWidget. We use this API called ImageKitIO to manage all images for the products. The database is also hosted online and uses MySQL. 

# PR Guidelines

# Issue/Bug guidelines
Please start working on the issue only once the maintainer has assigned it to you. Working on it without information to the maintainer might make your work redundant and you will end up wasting your precious time at Hacknight! 

# !Note: PyQt5 does not run natively on Apple Silicon. You have to emulate python using rosetta and then install PyQt5 through pip. The brew version of PyQt5 does not work! Approach maintainers if you are not sure.
