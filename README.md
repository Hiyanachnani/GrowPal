# !! HACKNIGHT SECTION !!
## What the project does?
This project aims to build a platform for small scale business owners in apartment societies to connect and sell their products. Business owners now just advertise their products on common WhatsApp groups which becomes spam after a while and the group is muted. This voids any kind of advertisement or online representation for these small scale sellers. You might have seen this happening to people in your apartment society who sell Tupperware bottles, cooking services, small accessories, etc. 

## What the project is built on?
This project is built on Python and the Qt framework. It is a Desktop Application. It was not intended for production when it was initially developed but was just a prototype to test things.
